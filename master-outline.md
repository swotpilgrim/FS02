## ACT 1: SETUP & RECRUITMENT (Chapters 1-8)

### Chapter 1: Desert Daughter

El Paso, present day. Sarah Mackenzie works private security, guarding construction sites in border country. Flashback sequence establishes her childhood: Border Patrol father Robert taught her desert navigation, search-and-rescue techniques, survival skills. By sixteen she was finding lost migrants when official teams gave up. Her gift for night navigation and sensory awareness was evident early. Present timeline shows her competence but also her isolation—she works alone, speaks little, processes grief through motion. Brief mention of brother Danny (Army, died in Vietnam 1972). Chapter ends with Sarah receiving encrypted call: CIA wants to meet. She agrees, curious but wary.

### Chapter 2: The Storm Rescue

Flashback to 1975 recruitment moment. Sarah was working as wilderness guide when family of four got lost in desert storm—zero visibility, disorienting winds, search teams couldn't operate. Sarah went out alone, tracked them fifteen miles in complete darkness using sound, air pressure changes, intuition. Found them sheltering in an arroyo, hypothermic but alive. CIA observer was embedded with search team, witnessed her abilities. He approached her afterward: "How did you do that?" Sarah couldn't fully explain—she just knew where they were. CIA offered testing. She accepted, needing purpose after Danny's death. Chapter shows her grief is still raw, driving her toward anything that feels like forward motion.

### Chapter 3: Nighteye Training

Six months at PROJECT NIGHTEYE facility in Arizona desert. Sensory deprivation training, navigation in total darkness, threat detection in simulated chaos. Sarah excels—her natural abilities amplify under structured training. Weapons work: she's exceptional with knives, adequate with firearms. Hand-to-hand combat: brutal efficiency. Instructors note her emotional control is excellent but possibly unhealthy—she never talks about her brother, deflects personal questions. Psychological evaluation flags her as high-functioning but carrying unresolved trauma. Training officer approves her for field deployment anyway: "Grief makes some people sharp. She's sharp." Final test: seventy-two hour solo desert survival with pursuit team hunting her. She evades them completely, completes extraction. Graduates to operational status.

### Chapter 4: Mission Brief

CIA safe house, El Paso. Handler Thomas Beck briefs Sarah: Soviet weapons scientist Dr. Viktor Petrov wants to defect, needs extraction from Juarez. Off-books operation—no official border crossing, no records. Forty-mile desert route to New Mexico safe house. Petrov has critical intelligence on bioweapon programs. Timeline: twenty-four hours. Beck emphasizes solo operation—no backup due to diplomatic sensitivity. Sarah accepts, confident in her desert skills. Beck mentions Petrov worked on weapons systems, including small arms used in Vietnam. Sarah registers this but doesn't connect it to Danny yet. Before she leaves, her father calls—awkward conversation, he heard she's working for government, wants to reconnect. She cuts it short, promises to call later. Won't keep that promise.

### Chapter 5: The Coyote

Beck provides intel on threat: Mateo Garza, "The Coyote," controls this stretch of border. Former Border Patrol turned cartel enforcer. Runs smuggling operations, violently territorial. KGB likely hired him to intercept Petrov. Beck shows Sarah surveillance photos: Garza is wiry, scarred, moves like he owns the desert. His signature kill method: "The Thirst"—victims staked in sun with water just out of reach, die over days. Fifteen confirmed kills this way. Beck warns Sarah: if Garza catches her, death will be slow. Sarah studies the maps, identifies three water cache points she'll pre-position. She knows this terrain as well as Garza does. Confidence is high. This is just another desert crossing, just with higher stakes.

### Chapter 6: Juarez Rendezvous

Night. Sarah crosses into Juarez, reaches abandoned warehouse district. Petrov is waiting—thin, balding, nervous, exactly as described. He's terrified, keeps looking over his shoulder. Sarah calms him with professional efficiency: "Stay close, do what I say, we'll be fine." They begin the crossing at 2200 hours. First ten miles are hard-pack flats, good time. Petrov struggles to keep pace, complains about heat even though it's nighttime. Sarah adjusts, slows slightly. He tries to make conversation—asks about her background, her training. She deflects. He talks about himself instead: physicist, weapons design specialist, twenty years with Soviet military. Sarah listens with half attention, focused on navigation. No sign of pursuit yet. Stars are bright. She's in her element.

### Chapter 7: The Rifle

Mile twelve. Petrov is tiring but talking more—nerves make him chatty. He mentions specific projects: bioweapon aerosol systems, chemical delivery mechanisms, small arms optimization. Sarah asks what he means by optimization. Petrov explains: experimental rifle designed for battlefield chaos—wounds that don't kill immediately but incapacitate slowly, maximize medical resource drain, psychological impact on enemy units. Tested in Afghanistan, exported to allies. Some units ended up in Vietnam. Sarah stops walking. She asks when. Petrov says 1971-1972. She asks about wound characteristics. He describes them: specific tissue damage pattern, slow bleed-out, difficult to treat in field conditions. Sarah knows these wounds. Danny died from them. Bled out over six hours waiting for medevac that arrived too late. She's staring at Petrov in the darkness. He doesn't notice, keeps talking.

### Chapter 8: Recognition

Sarah confirms it: Petrov designed the weapon that killed Danny. She asks directly—experimental rifle, specific model number Danny's after-action report mentioned. Petrov confirms yes, that was his design, very successful from engineering perspective. Sarah goes silent. Petrov finally notices something is wrong, asks if she's okay. She says she's fine, they need to keep moving. Internally she's calculating: she's alone in the desert with her brother's killer. Contract says protect him. Duty says deliver him to safe house. Grief says put a bullet in his head and leave him for the vultures. No one would know. Accident in the desert, happens all the time. She could do it right now. Her hand moves toward her pistol. Petrov is oblivious, drinking water. She doesn't draw. Not yet. But the mission just became unbearable. Chapter ends: "Forty miles to go. Protecting the man who killed Danny. This is what duty costs."

## ACT 2: OPERATION & ESCALATION (Chapters 9-22)

### Chapter 9: The Calculus

Sarah and Petrov continue walking. She's operating on autopilot—navigation, threat scanning, pace management—while her mind spirals. She runs scenarios: kill him now (quick, clean, mission failure), abandon him (let Garza have him, walk away), or complete the mission (protect her brother's killer). Duty versus rage. She remembers Danny's funeral—closed casket, flag presentation, her father's face collapsing. Petrov caused that. Every step she takes protecting him is betrayal of Danny's memory. But Beck's orders are clear: deliver the asset. If she fails, her career is over, NIGHTEYE credibility suffers, she goes back to El Paso with nothing. The calculation is impossible. No right answer. She stays silent, keeps walking. Petrov asks if they're on schedule. She says yes. Lies are easy now.

### Chapter 10: Oblivious

Mile eighteen. Petrov is exhausted but still talking—doesn't read Sarah's silence as hostility, interprets it as professional focus. He talks about his work with clinical detachment: trajectories, metallurgy, tissue damage optimization. Each word is a knife. Sarah imagines grabbing him, asking "Do you know what six hours of bleeding out feels like? My brother does." But she says nothing. Petrov mentions he has daughter back in Soviet Union, misses her terribly. Sarah's contempt deepens—he gets to miss his child, Danny's children will never exist. The moral simplicity is almost comforting: Petrov is evil, deserves death, and she has the power to deliver it. Only duty restrains her. First hint of pursuit: distant sound, maybe vehicles. Sarah stops, listens. Gone now. Could be nothing. Could be Garza. She increases pace.

### Chapter 11: First Contact

Mile twenty-two. Sarah spots tire tracks crossing their route—fresh, within last few hours. Multiple vehicles. Garza's men are ahead of them, not behind. They've predicted the route. Sarah adjusts course, swings wider west, adds five miles to the journey but avoids obvious intercept points. Petrov complains about the detour. She ignores him. An hour later: distant lights, vehicles stationary near where they would have been. Garza's men waiting. Sarah bypasses them in darkness, using terrain features for concealment. Her night vision advantage is critical—she can see them, they can't see her. But the fact they're here at all means someone leaked the route details. Mission security is compromised. Sarah considers: did Beck know this would happen? Is she being set up? Paranoia seeds itself. She keeps moving, trusting nothing now except her own skills.

### Chapter 12: Poisoned Cache

Dawn approaching. They reach water cache #2—rock outcropping where Sarah pre-positioned supplies two weeks ago. She approaches cautiously, spots disturbance immediately. Cache has been opened, contents scattered. Water containers are present but opened. Sarah tests: poisoned, smells like antifreeze. Someone found her cache, contaminated it. Garza. He's not just pursuing, he's controlling their resources, herding them. Sarah has one water bottle left, maybe six hours' worth for two people in rising heat. Next cache is fifteen miles ahead. Petrov sees the poisoned water, panics: "We're going to die out here." Sarah corrects him: "You might die. I'll be fine." It's not reassurance, it's calculation. If she has to choose between both dying of thirst or one surviving, she knows who she'll prioritize. And it's not him. She rations water strictly, moves on.

### Chapter 13: Daylight Crossing

Morning heat builds fast—85°F by 0800, heading toward 105°F by noon. Sarah wanted to complete this crossing entirely at night, but Garza's interference has slowed them. Now they're exposed in daylight, and Petrov is struggling badly—sunburned, dehydrated, stumbling. Sarah considers leaving him, completing the mission solo, reporting he couldn't keep pace. Tempting. But Beck's orders require delivery of the asset alive. She adjusts: finds shaded arroyo, they'll wait out the worst heat, move again at dusk. Petrov collapses in shade, nearly weeping with relief. Sarah stands watch. She's barely sweating—heat doesn't bother her the way it bothers others. Danny used to joke she was part lizard. Memory of Danny hurts. She watches Petrov sleep and imagines letting him wake to find her gone. Just walking away. Leaving him for the desert or Garza, whichever finds him first.

### Chapter 14: The Ambush

Dusk. They resume movement toward cache #3. Sarah is hyper-alert now—Garza is ahead of them, behind them, controlling the terrain. She expects contact. It comes at narrow arroyo crossing. Two men positioned on ridgeline, waiting. Sarah spots them before they spot her—their silhouettes break the horizon line, amateur mistake. She signals Petrov to stay down, circles wide. Comes at them from upslope. Close-quarters knife work—first man dies silent, second gets off one shot before she kills him. Gunshot echoes across desert. Petrov is screaming in terror. Sarah retrieves weapons from bodies: one AK-47, ammunition, radio. She listens to radio: Garza's voice, asking for check-in. His men don't respond. Garza knows something's wrong. Sarah destroys the radio, takes the AK. Two kills. Seventeen more before this is over, she estimates. Petrov is staring at bodies, shocked by the violence. She tells him, "Move or die here." He moves.

### Chapter 15: The Offer

Night, mile thirty-two. Radio Sarah took crackles to life: Garza's voice, speaking English. "Sarah Mackenzie. Robert's daughter. I remember you—skinny kid following your dad around the desert. You grew up mean." He knows who she is. Worked with her father. This is personal now. Garza continues: "I'm paid to bring the Russian in alive. You, I'm not paid for. Walk away now, you live. Stay with him, you die screaming." Sarah doesn't respond but keeps radio on, listens. Garza: "You got two of my men. Good kills. But I have six more, plus dogs. You can't win this. Be smart." Offer is real—she could walk away, disappear into desert, report mission failure, survive. Petrov is staring at her, terrified she'll take it. Sarah turns radio off. Doesn't dignify the offer with response. But the calculation shifts: this isn't just duty now, it's pride. Garza thinks she'll fold. She won't.

### Chapter 16: Breaking Point

Mile thirty-four. Petrov is falling apart—exhausted, terrified, guilt-stricken. The violence has broken his clinical detachment. He starts confessing: feels terrible about his work, knows he caused suffering, couldn't face it while employed by state but defection forces confrontation. Sarah listens with cold contempt. Petrov: "Do you know what it's like, designing things that kill people you'll never meet?" Sarah thinks: Yes, my brother met your design. Petrov continues, near tears: "I never saw the bodies, never had to account for the human cost. It was just mathematics, engineering problems." Sarah breaks silence: "Shut up. Keep walking." Petrov: "You don't understand—" Sarah: "I understand fine. You built weapons. People died. You feel bad. I don't care. Move faster." Her rage is leaking through professional control. Petrov hears it, goes quiet. Some truths are too dangerous to speak in the desert at night.

### Chapter 17: The Daughter

Mile thirty-six, near cache #3. Petrov tries again to humanize himself: "I had a daughter. Elena. She died last year." Sarah doesn't respond. Petrov continues anyway—needs to confess, needs absolution she won't give. Elena was nineteen, university student, killed in lab accident. One of Petrov's bioweapon prototypes leaked during testing. She was visiting him at work, wrong place, wrong time. Died over three days—respiratory failure, hemorrhaging, agony. Petrov held her hand through it. Her death broke him, showed him what his work actually meant: someone's daughter, suffering, dying from weapons he designed for abstract strategic purposes. That's why he defected—couldn't build more weapons after watching Elena die from one. Sarah processes this. It doesn't excuse him. Danny was someone's son. But it complicates her hate. Petrov lost daughter to his own evil. That's a different kind of hell. She doesn't forgive him. But the simple moral clarity is gone now. Just gray wasteland left.

### Chapter 18: Cache Ambush

They reach cache #3: rock formation, supplies hidden in crevice. Sarah approaches tactical—this one might be poisoned too. It's not poisoned. It's bait. Garza's remaining men are positioned around it—classic L-shaped ambush. Sarah spots them just before trigger point, drops flat, pulls Petrov down. Gunfire erupts—automatic weapons, poorly aimed but overwhelming volume. Sarah returns fire with AK, suppressing them. Petrov is screaming. Sarah drags him behind rocks, assesses: four shooters, good positions, daylight coming soon. She can't win firefight directly. She waits for lull, tosses canteen into open ground. Two shooters focus on movement. She shoots them during their distraction—both headshots, immediate kills. Remaining two shooters panic, break position. She kills one, wounds the other. Wounded man crawls toward vehicle. Sarah executes him. Four more bodies. Cache is intact—water, food, ammunition. Small victory. But Garza still has men and dogs. This isn't over.

### Chapter 19: The Box Canyon

Mile thirty-eight. Final stretch to safe house, but Garza is close now—Sarah hears dogs in distance, vehicle engines. Petrov can barely walk. She could move faster alone, but she's committed now. Pride, duty, spite—doesn't matter which, outcome is same. She chooses ground for final stand: box canyon with vertical walls, narrow entry, rock formations for cover. Tactically sound—negates Garza's numbers, forces bottleneck engagement. She positions Petrov in deep crevice: "Stay here, don't move, don't make sound." He nods, too terrified to argue. Sarah sets up: elevated position, overlapping fields of fire, AK and pistol both loaded. She has perhaps twenty minutes before they arrive. The sun is rising, harsh light filling canyon. Temperature climbing. Her advantage was always darkness—now she's fighting in daylight. But the terrain is hers. Danny died in jungle ambush, overwhelmed by terrain he didn't know. She won't make that mistake. This is her desert. Garza is coming to her kingdom.

### Chapter 20: Preparation

Sarah uses twenty minutes efficiently: improvised tripwires from paracord, rocks positioned for dislodging on approaches, sightlines cleared. She's done this in training dozens of times—turning terrain into weapon. Her hands are steady. No fear, just tactical focus. She thinks about Danny briefly—wonders if he felt fear in his final moments, or if training took over like it's taking over for her now. Probably both. Petrov watches from his hiding spot, sees her work, understands she's genuinely skilled. He asks: "Will we survive this?" Sarah: "I will." Not cruelty, just honesty. She's made her decision: complete the mission despite everything—despite Petrov being her brother's killer, despite Beck's possible betrayal, despite the moral impossibility. She'll protect him because that's what she was assigned to do, and duty is all she has left. Garza's voice echoes up canyon: "Last chance, Sarah!" She doesn't answer. Checks ammunition one final time. Seventeen rounds in AK, nine in pistol. Has to be enough.

### Chapter 21: Dark Night

The waiting. Garza is positioning his men, taking his time. Psychological warfare—let her anticipate, let fear build. But Sarah doesn't fear, she calculates. Six men plus Garza (based on radio chatter she's intercepted), three dogs. She'll kill dogs first—they're the real threat in confined terrain. Then men. Then Garza. Simple math. She thinks about Beck: did he know this mission would turn into massacre? Did he send her here to test if NIGHTEYE operatives can handle moral compromise under lethal pressure? Is she test subject as much as operative? The paranoia is clear-eyed now, not panic. She accepts it: institutions use people. Beck used her. Garza is trying to kill her. Petrov killed Danny. Everyone is guilty. Only question is who survives. Her radio crackles—Garza: "Your father would be ashamed. Killing your own people for a Russian." Sarah keys mic: "You're not my people. You're just prey." Breaks radio. No more talking. Only violence now.

### Chapter 22: The Dogs

Garza sends dogs first—three rottweilers, trained for attack. They bound up canyon, snarling. Sarah hates this—hates killing dogs, they're just tools. But necessary. She shoots all three—clean kills, efficient. The gunfire echoes. Garza's men hesitate at canyon mouth, spooked by how fast she dropped the dogs. Sarah doesn't give them time to regroup. Shoots at the shadows near entry—forces them into cover. She's controlling the engagement tempo, not them. One man breaks cover, tries to rush. She shoots him twice—center mass, then headshot. He drops. Five men plus Garza left. Radio chatter (she can hear them shouting to each other): they didn't expect this level of resistance. Thought she was just a guide, not a killer. They're reassessing. Garza is shouting orders: flank left, suppressing fire. Sarah smiles grimly. They're playing her game now. The desert taught her patience. She waits, watches, shoots when targets present themselves. Two more down before they retreat to regroup. Garza is learning: this won't be easy.

## ACT 3: CONFRONTATION & RESOLUTION (Chapters 23-30)

### Chapter 23: Canyon Warfare

Full dawn, temperature spiking. Three men plus Garza remain. They try coordinated assault—suppressing fire while two flank right along canyon wall. Sarah anticipated this, positioned herself for crossfire. She kills one flanker, wounds the other. He falls screaming into rocks below. Garza pulls back his men—he's lost six out of seven now. Only two gunmen left plus himself. Sarah is winning through terrain knowledge and superior marksmanship. But she's low on ammunition—four rounds left in AK, six in pistol. She scavenges from dead attackers: finds two more magazines. Petrov is still hidden, silent, probably praying. Sarah reloads, hydrates, waits. The sun is brutal now, no shade in her position. Sweat finally starting despite her heat tolerance. Garza is shouting from canyon mouth: "You're good. Better than I thought. But you're trapped. I have water, time, reinforcements coming. You have nothing." He's wrong. She has hate, duty, and desert expertise. That's enough.

### Chapter 24: Attrition

Noon. Standoff continues. Garza's remaining men try different approaches—one attempts climb along canyon wall, loses grip, falls twenty feet onto rocks. Breaks his leg, screaming. Sarah doesn't shoot him—let him suffer, reduce Garza's morale. Only one gunman left now plus Garza. The wounded man keeps screaming. Garza shoots his own man—mercy kill or silencing liability, doesn't matter which. Now it's just Garza and one loyal soldier. Sarah calls out: "Send your last man. Let's finish this." Garza laughs: "You're bleeding." She is—caught rock fragment from ricochet earlier, gash across forearm. Not serious but he spotted it. Garza: "I can wait. You'll get weaker." Sarah: "So come take me." The last gunman makes his move—rushes with automatic fire. Sarah drops him with three shots. Now it's just Garza. Canyon goes quiet. Two killers left standing. Sarah shouts: "Just you now." Garza: "Just me is enough." He's wrong. But he believes it.

### Chapter 25: The Coyote

Garza enters canyon alone, moves with tactical competence—uses cover, advances carefully. Sarah tracks him through scope, but he's smart, doesn't present clean shot. He's circling, trying to flank. She repositions, keeps elevation advantage. He spots her movement, fires—hits close, rock chips spray her face. She returns fire, misses. They're both low on ammunition now. Garza: "Your brother—what was his name?" Trying to shake her. Sarah doesn't answer. Garza: "Did he die slow? My weapons make people die slow. It's better that way—terror spreads." He's guessing, fishing for reaction. But he guessed right. Sarah's rage spikes. She breaks cover, fires three shots. One hits—Garza's shoulder, not fatal. He drops behind rocks. She advances. No more long-range tactics. This ends close. She finds him reloading, kicks the rifle from his hands. He's fast—draws knife, slashes at her. She blocks, grabs his wrist, they grapple. Hand-to-hand in the rocks.

### Chapter 26: Personal

The fight is brutal—no technique, just violence. Garza is strong, experienced, vicious. Sarah is younger, faster, fueled by four years of grief. They crash through rocks, trading blows. He slams her head into stone—her vision blurs. She drives knee into his wounded shoulder—he screams. They separate, circle. Both bleeding, exhausted. Garza: "You're Border Patrol family. We could have worked together." Sarah: "You torture people in the desert sun." Garza grins: "The Thirst. Very effective." He's proud of it. Sarah sees red. She charges, tackles him, they go down together. Knife fight in the dirt—she blocks his blade, traps his arm, breaks it at elbow. He roars, tries to bite her face. She headbutts him, grabs a rock, smashes his skull. Once, twice, three times. He stops moving. Sarah keeps hitting him. Four years of rage pouring out. Finally stops, panting. Garza is dead, face caved in. It's not clean. It's not professional. It's murder wearing duty's uniform. She stands, covered in his blood. Petrov is watching, horrified. She doesn't care.

### Chapter 27: The Cost

Sarah is injured—concussion probable, facial lacerations, arm gash worse than she thought. Adrenaline fading, pain arriving. She scavenges water from dead men's supplies, drinks heavily. Petrov emerges from hiding, helps her bandage wounds with shaking hands. He's seen what she's capable of now—understands she could have killed him anytime, still could. He asks quietly: "Why did you protect me?" Sarah: "Orders." Petrov: "That's all?" Sarah thinks about it. Orders, yes. Pride, yes. But also: if she'd killed him, it would have been revenge, not justice. Danny deserved better than her becoming murderer. She says: "That's all." They have fifteen miles to safe house, and Sarah can barely walk straight. Concussion is affecting her balance. Petrov supports her weight—irony is not lost on either of them. The man she wanted to kill is now keeping her alive. They walk through afternoon heat, past dead men, dead dogs, the wreckage of the canyon battle. The desert will clean it up eventually. Always does.

### Chapter 28: Extraction

Late afternoon, they reach safe house—concrete bunker disguised as abandoned ranch building. CIA team is waiting, surprised to see them. Sarah is nearly catatonic from concussion and exhaustion. Petrov explains: attacked by cartel forces, operative eliminated all hostiles, protected asset successfully. CIA medic treats Sarah: stitches, fluids, concussion protocol. Beck arrives via helicopter, debriefs Petrov first. Sarah watches from medical cot—Beck doesn't look surprised by the violence, doesn't question why Garza's entire crew is dead. He knew. He knew this would be bloody, possibly knew Sarah would discover Petrov's identity, possibly sent her anyway as test of program resilience. When Beck finally approaches Sarah, she asks: "Did you know what Petrov designed?" Beck: "We knew his specialties, yes." Sarah: "Did you know about my brother?" Beck hesitates. "We knew. You were assigned because you're the best desert operative, despite complications." Despite. Sarah laughs bitterly. She was test subject and operative simultaneously. Beck: "You completed the mission. NIGHTEYE's value is confirmed." Sarah: "Glad I could help the program." Hollow sarcasm. Beck offers recuperation time, then next assignment. Sarah accepts. What else is there?

### Chapter 29: Debriefing

Two days later. Sarah is recovering in El Paso safe house. Concussion improving, wounds healing. Beck conducts formal debrief: nineteen confirmed kills (Garza's men, Garza himself, dogs counted in total), asset delivered intact, mission success. Petrov is already in protective custody, being interrogated by weapons specialists. His intelligence on Soviet bioweapon programs is valuable—justifies the cost. Beck commends Sarah's performance: "Exceptional work under compromised conditions. The program is proud." Sarah asks about mission security leak—how did Garza know the route? Beck admits: suspected mole in Mexico City station, investigation ongoing. Might never know for sure. Sarah accepts this—she's learning that spy work doesn't offer closure, just new complications. Beck offers her next assignment: surveillance op in San Francisco, low-risk. She can decline, take extended leave. Sarah declines the leave. Staying still means thinking, and thinking means confronting what she's done. Better to keep moving. She accepts the assignment, ships out in one week.

### Chapter 30: The Photo

Night. Sarah sits in her El Paso apartment—spartan, temporary, nothing personal visible except one framed photo on the nightstand. Danny in dress uniform, taken just before deployment. Twenty years old, smiling, confident. He didn't know what was coming. Sarah stares at the photo, tries to feel something. Relief? She saved his killer, fulfilled duty. Anger? Beck used her grief as operational test. Pride? She survived impossible odds. But mostly she feels hollow. Danny is still dead. Petrov is alive, cooperating with American intelligence, possibly saving lives with his knowledge. The math works—one weapons designer's intelligence might prevent dozens of deaths. But it doesn't resurrect Danny. Doesn't make the mission feel like victory. Just another desert crossing, another pile of bodies, another morning of waking up without her brother. Her father calls—she doesn't answer. Too tired to explain, too damaged to pretend. Phone stops ringing. Outside, El Paso at night. Somewhere out there, the desert waits. It always waits. Sarah lies back, closes eyes. In a week she'll be in San Francisco. New mission, new terrain, same emptiness. The photo watches silently. Duty is what's left when everything else burns away. She's learned that now. Chapter ends: "Danny would have completed the mission too. That's what she tells herself. That's what she has to believe. The desert doesn't care either way."
